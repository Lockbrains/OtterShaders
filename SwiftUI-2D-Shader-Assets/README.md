# SwiftUI 2D Shader Assets 

There will be 3 types of effects for 2D shaders in SwiftUI:
- 1. `colorEffect`: if the effect ONLY changes color, find the shader in Color Effect Section
- 2. `layerEffect`: if the effect requires information from the background (neighboring pixels, background pixels, etc), find the shader in Layer Effect Section.
- 3. `distortEffect`: if the effect requires the morph of the shape / vertex manipulations, find the shader in the Distort Effect Section.

## How To Use

## System Requirement
The shader effects are available only on iOS after iOS 17. Make sure you meet the system requirement, otherwise there will be no effects.
